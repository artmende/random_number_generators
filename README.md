# random_number_generators
A simple tool to generate pseudo random numbers

**	Simply compile this main.c file.
**
**	Executing the program without any argument will display all numbers
**	between 0 and 19 in a pseudorandom order.
**
**	As first argument, you can specify how many numbers you want to display.
**	All numbers from 0 up to the number specified will be displayed in a
**	pseudorandom order.
**
**	As a second argument, you can type a hyphen '-'.
**	It will then display as many numbers as specified in the first argument, in
**	the same range, but some numbers might be negative (around 38%).
**
**	In all cases, there will be no repetition in the numbers displayed.
**
**	Enjoy !
